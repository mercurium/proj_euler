'''
Since each base i-1 representation refers to a number...
and they're unique... can we do something as simple as just including all base i-1 representations below a certain size?

like...
1101 and 111001 both probably refer to a gaussian integer < 10^15

1 : 1  = 1 * 2^0
2 : 4  = 2 * 2^1
3 : 12 = 3 * 2^2
4 : 32 = 4 * 2^3
