This repo is just my project euler files. I programmed mostly in python as shown here because the majority of the time that my program is running has already been reduced by figuring out smarter ways to do the problems. For the slower problems, I wrote it in java but the main ideas for each problem are here.

Also note: a lot of this code is from when I started learning python and I haven't gotten around to cleaning it yet so if it looks sloppy... my bad =/...
